# Map Festival

As part of the [Science Festival 2019](https://www.science-festival.lu/) (7th-10th November), the [Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning](http://bit.ly/2Jz3gAe) of the University of Luxembourg is organising a mini Map Festival!

The event is targeting kids for the two first days and the general public during the weekend.

Through a set of fun and engaging hands-on activities, the workshops aim at encouraging people to discover and learn about how we create digital models and maps of where we live using a technology called Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
 
The final objective is that kids, teenagers and adults leave us with a better understanding of how do we represent and create maps of the world using the computers.

## Introduction: Spatial data?

- Contour map of Luxembourg: kids are introduced the notion of space and geometries (points, lines and polygons)
